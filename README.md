# Gwen Laws Portfolio Site
This is a website made for my final project for axd 252 - web typography.
It was a challenging and exciting project. I struggled with finding a good color pallet that fit well but was not obnoxious. It was difficult to properly align the icon on the landing page and to link my resume. The resume does not have a button to return to the portfolio site. I also had difficulties with making a responsive layout for mobile visitors, and with finding a good rounded font for the links and the landing page. 

I did have a good time experiementing with layouts and images, the about me page was fun to mess around with and figure out the best way to lay it out.
